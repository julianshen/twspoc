# Creating a GitHub Repository for Nebula

To create a GitHub repository for the Nebula project, follow these steps:

## 1. Create a New Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in with your account
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Enter the following information:
   - Repository name: `nebula`
   - Description: `A Go-based event trigger system using etcd for configuration storage with dynamic reloading capabilities`
   - Visibility: Public
   - Initialize this repository with:
     - Add a README file
     - Add .gitignore (select "Go")
     - Choose a license (e.g., MIT License)
4. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/julianshen/nebula.git
cd nebula
```

## 3. Copy Project Files

Copy all the project files from your current directory to the cloned repository:

```bash
cp -r /Users/julianshen/prj/nebula/* /path/to/cloned/nebula/
```

## 4. Commit and Push Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: etcd-based trigger system implementation"
git push origin main
```

## 5. Verify Repository

Visit `https://github.com/julianshen/nebula` to verify that your repository has been created and all files have been uploaded successfully.

## Repository Structure

The repository will contain the following key components:

- **Trigger Store Interface**: A Go interface that defines the contract for trigger storage implementations
- **etcd Implementation**: An etcd-backed trigger store with dynamic reloading capabilities
- **Docker Integration**: Docker Compose configuration for running the complete system
- **Utility Tools**: Tools for testing and managing triggers
- **End-to-End Tests**: Comprehensive tests for the entire system
